# Martian Chess
Jake Roman, Jake Andersen, Cameron Jefferys

This was created for CSC 4899 Senior Project.
Martian Chess is a unique combinatorial game that handles piece ownership based on position rather than color.
Our project involved creating this game in Dr. Kyle Burke's combinatorial games framework, as well as creating and training a reinforcement learning player to play against.

The results of our project is a game you can play on https://kyleburke.info/DB/combGames/martianChess.html
